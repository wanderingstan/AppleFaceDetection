# Face Detection with Vision Framework
#### This project build on iOS 11 in Swift 4.

Previously, in iOS 10, to detect faces in a picture, you can use [CIDetector](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coreimage/cidetector) (Apple)
or [Mobile Vision](https://developers.google.com/vision/face-detection-concepts) (Google)

In iOS11, Apple introduces [CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml). With the **Vision Framework**, it's much easier to detect human faces in real time :D

Now added detection of all landmarks within the face.
